# The package `CL`

This package defines the OpenCL scalar types that are available in the OpenCL C
programming language. They are used for data transfer between your Ada
application and your OpenCL kernels. The corresponding multi-value vector types
can be found in [`CL.Vectors`]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/cl-vectors.html).

Also contained are all exceptions that can be raised by OpenCL. OpenCL API
functions always return a value that indicates whether an error occurred.
OpenCLAda checks this return value and raises the appropriate exception if an
error occurred.

The base type for all OpenCL object types, `CL_Object`, is also defined here.
The derived types `Runtime_Object` is the base type for all objects you can
create at runtime (in contrast to the OpenCL `Platform` and `Device` which are
provided by your system and cannot be altered).
